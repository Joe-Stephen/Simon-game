# Introduction
Welcome to my Simon Memory Game Replica! ðŸŽ® This project is a modern web-based recreation of the classic Simon game, which was originally released by Milton Bradley in 1978. The goal of the game is to test and challenge your memory skills by repeating increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds.

You can play the game live here : https://joe-stephen.github.io/Simon-game/.

# Tech Stack

HTML: For the basic structure and layout.
CSS: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: For the game logic and interactivity.
jQuery: To simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.
Firebase: To store and retrieve high scores in real-time.

# How to Play

1. Start the Game: Click the 'Start' button to begin.
2. Watch the Sequence: Pay attention to the sequence of lights and sounds.
3. Repeat the Sequence: Click the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. Continue Playing: The sequence will get longer each round. Try to remember and repeat the increasingly complex sequences.
5. High Scores: If you achieve a high score, it will be saved and displayed in the leaderboard.

# Features

Classic Gameplay: Faithful replication of the original Simon game mechanics.
High Score Tracking: Uses Firebase to store and display high scores.
Responsive Design: Works on various screen sizes and devices.
Engaging UI/UX: Simple and clean interface with smooth animations and sound effects.

# Learnings and Challenges
*Recreating a Classic: It was an interesting challenge to replicate the game mechanics of a well-known classic game.
*Firebase Integration: This was my first experience using Firebase, and it was insightful to see how it can be used for real-time data storage and retrieval.
*Asynchronous JavaScript: Handling asynchronous events to ensure smooth gameplay required careful planning and execution.
*UI/UX Design: Balancing the nostalgic feel of the original game with modern web design principles was both challenging and rewarding.
